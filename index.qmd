## The Challenge of Reproducibility

* Create a well-defined computational **"environment"**
* Document required software, data and where to get them
* Document steps to reproduce analysis

## MATLAB can be ... challenging

* Packages/lack thereof, project manageent, dependency management, the path
* Proprietary source code
* MathWorks get most of their income from industry - so aren't largely motivated to develop open source tools and guidance
* Lots of weird binary file formats
* Doesn't get a lot of attention from software engineers

## So why bother?

Lots of researchers use MATLAB, they aren't all going to stop

# The Solution

## MATLAB 'Projects'

## Version Control/Open Source Development

## Licensing

## Documentation

# Guiding Principles for Reproducibility (in my opinion..)

* write documentation
* think about environment management
* write examples (documentation)
* tutorials (also documentation)
* project organisation
* explain how to use the code (documentation)
